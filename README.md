# Introduction 

This assignment looks at the Earthquake Data, and creating visualizations based on the depth of the earthquakes. The USGS Data was used to capture the information. Leaflet was used to plot all the earthquakes and legend. 

# Description

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Information presented in geoJSON format (dictionary format)
Web scraping used to search the properties for magnitude and depth. This allowed to get an in depth look at the properties of each earthquake (geometry, properties, type)
The popups were created to show the location of the earthquake and what date and time it occured. 
Legend created to visualize the magnitude of the earthquake
